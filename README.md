# RetroCalc
iOS app for calculating basic calculations. Created as practice in Swift by following Mark Price's iOS/Swift course on Udemy, some little own tweaks added. Doesn't unfortunately follow MVC architecture.

# Features
  - Basic add, subtract, multiply and divide calculations
  - Clear button
  - Does not crash when dividing with zero 😉
